作者：Akhil Saketh Reddy Sabbella

摘要：In the poultry industry, detecting chicken illnesses is essential to avoid financial losses. Conventional techniques depend on manual observation, which is laborious and prone to mistakes. Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for real\-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8 detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides accurate real\-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing biosecurity in large\-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health management. The real\-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective method for improving farm management techniques.

## Deep learning framework for crater detection and identification on the Moon and Mars / 

发布日期：2025-08-05

作者：Yihan Ma

摘要：Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional Neural Networks \(CNNs\) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a framework that features a two\-stage approach where the first stage features crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet\-50 and YOLO. In the second stage, our framework employs YOLO\-based detection for crater localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet\-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

## YOLOv1 to YOLOv11: A Comprehensive Survey of Real\-Time Object Detection Innovations and Challenges / 

发布日期：2025-08-04

作者：Manikanta Kotthapalli

摘要：Over the past decade, object detection has advanced significantly, with the YOLO \(You Only Look Once\) family of models transforming the landscape of real\-time vision applications through unified, end\-to\-end detection frameworks. From YOLOv1's pioneering regression\-based detection to the latest YOLOv9, each version has systematically enhanced the balance between speed, accuracy, and deployment efficiency through continuous architectural and algorithmic advancements.. Beyond core object detection, modern YOLO architectures have expanded to support tasks such as instance segmentation, pose estimation, object tracking, and domain\-specific applications including medical imaging and industrial automation. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the YOLO family, highlighting architectural innovations, performance benchmarks, extended capabilities, and real\-world use cases. We critically analyze the evolution of YOLO models and discuss emerging research directions that extend their impact across diverse computer vision domains.

## Self\-Supervised YOLO: Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Label\-Efficient Object Detection / 

发布日期：2025-08-04

作者：Manikanta Kotthapalli

摘要：One\-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state\-of\-the\-art performance in real\-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on large\-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self\-supervised learning \(SSL\) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset \(120k images\). The pretrained backbones are then fine\-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision\-recall performance, especially in low\-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR\-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one\-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label\-efficient object detection.

## SBP\-YOLO:A Lightweight Real\-Time Model for Detecting Speed Bumps and Potholes / 

发布日期：2025-08-02

作者：Chuanqi Liang

摘要：With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate real\-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive suspension control. This paper proposes SBP\-YOLO, a lightweight detection framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model integrates GhostConv for efficient computation, VoVGSCSPC for multi\-scale feature enhancement, and a Lightweight Efficiency Detection Head \(LEDH\) to reduce early\-stage feature processing costs. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations\-based weather augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant targets. Experiments show SBP\-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP \(outperforming YOLOv11n by 5.8%\) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16 quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real\-time road condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.
