## YOLO\-PRO: Enhancing Instance\-Specific Object Detection with Full\-Channel Global Self\-Attention / 

发布日期：2025-03-04

作者：Lin Huang

摘要：This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures \(diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics\) and decoupled heads \(computational redundancy\) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance\-Specific Bottleneck with full\-channel global self\-attention \(ISB\) and the Instance\-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head \(ISADH\). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full\-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch\-statistical and instance\-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi\-dimensional feature integration via dual\-stream batch\-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS\-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO\-PRO framework achieves state\-of\-the\-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO\-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0\-1.6% AP \(N/S/M/L/X scales\) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1\-0.5% AP in critical M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high\-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.

## Evaluating Stenosis Detection with Grounding DINO, YOLO, and DINO\-DETR / 

发布日期：2025-03-03

作者：Muhammad Musab Ansari

摘要：Detecting stenosis in coronary angiography is vital for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. This study evaluates the performance of state\-of\-the\-art object detection models on the ARCADE dataset using the MMDetection framework. The models are assessed using COCO evaluation metrics, including Intersection over Union \(IoU\), Average Precision \(AP\), and Average Recall \(AR\). Results indicate variations in detection accuracy across different models, attributed to differences in algorithmic design, transformer\-based vs. convolutional architectures. Additionally, several challenges were encountered during implementation, such as compatibility issues between PyTorch, CUDA, and MMDetection, as well as dataset inconsistencies in ARCADE. The findings provide insights into model selection for stenosis detection and highlight areas for further improvement in deep learning\-based coronary artery disease diagnosis.

## Rapid morphology characterization of two\-dimensional TMDs and lateral heterostructures based on deep learning / 

发布日期：2025-03-01

作者：Junqi He

摘要：Two\-dimensional \(2D\) materials and heterostructures exhibit unique physical properties, necessitating efficient and accurate characterization methods. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a deep learning\-based method for efficiently characterizing heterostructures and 2D materials, specifically MoS2\-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures and MoS2 flakes with varying shapes and thicknesses. By utilizing YOLO models, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 94.67% in identifying these materials. Additionally, we explore the application of transfer learning across different materials, which further enhances model performance. This model exhibits robust generalization and anti\-interference ability, ensuring reliable results in diverse scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have developed an application that enables real\-time analysis directly from optical microscope images, making the process significantly faster and more cost\-effective than traditional methods. This deep learning\-driven approach represents a promising tool for the rapid and accurate characterization of 2D materials, opening new avenues for research and development in material science.

## Improved YOLOv12 with LLM\-Generated Synthetic Data for Enhanced Apple Detection and Benchmarking Against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10 / 

发布日期：2025-02-26

作者：Ranjan Sapkota

摘要：This study evaluated the performance of the YOLOv12 object detection model, and compared against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10 for apple detection in commercial orchards using synthetic images generated by Large Language Models \(LLMs\). The YOLOv12n configuration excelled, achieving the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision \(mAP@50\) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which recorded the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l tied for the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. The study also highlighted efficiency in processing speeds, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new in more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, the YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO algorithm among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on high\-quality LLM\-generated datasets, not only surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics but also offered a cost\-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the field.

## Advanced YOLO\-based Real\-time Power Line Detection for Vegetation Management / 

发布日期：2025-02-26

作者：Shuaiang Rong

摘要：Power line infrastructure is a key component of the power system, and it is rapidly expanding to meet growing energy demands. Vegetation encroachment is a significant threat to the safe operation of power lines, requiring reliable and timely management to enhance the resilience and reliability of the power network. Integrating smart grid technology, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles \(UAVs\), provides substantial potential to revolutionize the management of extensive power line networks with advanced imaging techniques. However, processing the vast quantity of images captured by UAV patrols remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces an intelligent real\-time monitoring framework for detecting power lines and adjacent vegetation. It is developed based on the deep\-learning Convolutional Neural Network \(CNN\), You Only Look Once \(YOLO\), renowned for its high\-speed object detection capabilities. Unlike existing deep learning\-based methods, this framework enhances accuracy by integrating YOLOv8 with directional filters. They can extract directional features and textures of power lines and their vicinity, generating Oriented Bounding Boxes \(OBB\) for more precise localization. Additionally, a post\-processing algorithm is developed to create a vegetation encroachment metric for power lines, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the surrounding vegetation distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a widely used power line dataset.
